This is the GitHub repo for my book on careers. The book was converted into HTML using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). The HTML is rendered into a HTML Card on [Ghost](https://ghost.org) on my blog, [Skerritt.blog](https://skerritt.blog).

As such, the HTML is a bit off. If you find any errors with it, please submit a merge request or issue here. 

Alternatively, if you have stuff you want to add or rewrite, please submit a merge request or issue. This book is now open source. 

If you change something, your name will go into the acknowledgements section of the book.
