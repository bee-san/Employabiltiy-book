# What is this?
This is the GitHub repo for my book on careers. The book was converted into HTML using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). The HTML is rendered into a HTML Card on [Ghost](https://ghost.org) on my blog, [Skerritt.blog](https://skerritt.blog). 

It's a 34,000 word book on everything you could ever want to know about employability skills. You can read the entire book, online, for free on my blog:

[Read it here](https://page.skerritt.blog/job/)

## Where can I read this?

On my blog:

[Read it here](https://page.skerritt.blog/job/)

If you are privacy focussed, my blog doesn't track you. No Google Analytics,no ad-networks. My comments sytem even allows anonymous commenting.

Another way to read the book is to download the HTML file and view it yourself.

## Can I get a PDF?

Sure. Just sign up to my [email list](https://page.skerritt.blog/job/). You'll get the PDF with fancy table of contents.

## There's a mistake in your book! Or I want to add something.
If you want to add things to the book, you have 2 options:
* Submit an issue (or a merge request if you want to add the content yourself)
* Comment on my blog / Dev.to posting of the book

If you change something, your name will go into the acknowledgements section of the book. The e-book will be updated faster than the physical book. Everytime I update the physical book, I have to get a new ISBN number which costs $$$. I will let you know when the next physical edition is released :)
